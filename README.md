List of Exercises
1. The missionaries and cannibals’ problem is as follows. Three missionaries and three
cannibals are on one side of a river, along with a boat. The boat can hold one or two people
(and obviously cannot be paddled to the other side of the river with zero peopl
e in it). The goal is to get everyone to the other side, without ever leaving a group of missionaries
outnumbered by cannibals.

2. The game Tic Tac Toe is also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os ,the player needs
to take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with their own marks,if 3 consecutive marks
(Horizontal, Vertical,Diagonal) are formed then the player who owns these mo
ves get won.

3. There are two jugs of volume A litre and B litre. Neither has any measuring mark on it.
There is a pump that can be used to fill the jugs with water. How can you get exactly x litre
of water into the A litre jug. Assuming that we have unlimited supply of water. Write a
Program to Implement this Water Jug problem by formulating suitable state and solution space.

4. The n- queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard
so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share
the same row, column, or diagonal. There are 92 solutions. We have 8 que
ens and an 8x8
Chess board having al ternate black and white squares. The queens are placed on the
chessboard. Any queen can attack any other queen placed on same row, or column or
diagonal. We have to find the proper placement of queens on the Chess board in such a way
that no queen attacks other queen”. Write a Program to implement 8

5. The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. The Branch and Bound algorithm is a popular approach to solving this combinatorial optimization problem. It works by dividing the problem into smaller subproblems, and then using bounds to eliminate subproblems that cannot lead to the optimal solution. By intelligently combining branching and bounding techniques, the B&B algorithm can efficiently explore the solution space, providing valuable insights for optimization tasks in various domains such as logistics, transportation planning, and circuit board design.

6. A algorithm* is an informed search algorithm that combines the efficiency of Dijkstra's algorithm with the informedness of best-first search. It's particularly well-suited for problems where a heuristic function can estimate the cost of reaching the goal from a given state. A* uses a priority queue to store nodes based on their f-value, which is the sum of the g-value (cost so far) and the h-value (estimated cost to goal). By expanding nodes with the lowest f-value, A* efficiently explores the search space and can often find optimal or near-optimal solutions more quickly than uninformed search methods.

7. AO is a family of algorithms that aim to provide high-quality solutions within a given time constraint. By continuously searching for better solutions and terminating at any point, AO can guarantee to provide a solution within a specified time limit. It's particularly useful for optimization problems where finding the optimal solution is computationally expensive or infeasible, and can be applied to various domains such as traveling salesman, vehicle routing, and scheduling.

8. The Wumpus World is a classic artificial intelligence problem that involves exploring a dangerous cave filled with pits, bats, and a deadly Wumpus. The agent's goal is to find gold without falling into a pit or being killed by the Wumpus. The agent must use its senses (stench, breeze, glitter, and scream) to infer the location of these dangers and plan its actions accordingly. The Wumpus World is a valuable testbed for AI algorithms, as it requires reasoning, planning, and decision-making in a dynamic and uncertain environment.
