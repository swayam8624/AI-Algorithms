3. There are two jugs of volume A litre and B litre. Neither has any measuring mark on it.
There is a pump that can be used to fill the jugs with water. How can you get exactly x litre
of water into the A litre jug. Assuming that we have unlimited supply of water. Write a

5. The n- queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard
so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share
the same row, column, or diagonal. There are 92 solutions. We have 8 que
ens and an 8x8
Chess board having al ternate black and white squares. The queens are placed on the
chessboard. Any queen can attack any other queen placed on same row, or column or
diagonal. We have to find the proper placement of queens on the Chess board in such a way
that no queen attacks other queen”. Write a Program to implement 8
